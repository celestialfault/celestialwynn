# Celestial Wynn

**This project now lives on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celestialfault/celestialwynn)**

-----

A mod containing a collection of small patches for [Wynncraft], primarily aimed at fixing minor client-sided
bugs or improving the game experience in minor ways, while keeping the experience largely the same as if playing
without any mods.

## Current Features

- Fixes Silverbull armor visibility causing capes to "float"
- Hide the persistent territory bar shown while in a guild
- FOV Scaling, re-implemented from the 1.12.2 Wynntils feature
- `/chat` toggle that pre-fills the relevant chat command for you, designed similarly to the Hypixel one
- First person item scaling and positioning
